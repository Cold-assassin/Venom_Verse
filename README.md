🐍 VenomVerse — AI Antivenom Research Copilot
Turning Venom Into Hope — Powered by Responsible AI


🌍 Why VenomVerse?
Snakebite envenoming is a WHO‑recognized Neglected Tropical Disease.
Over 100,000 people die every year — mostly in rural, low‑income regions with little or no access to effective antivenoms.
Modern venom research is:
1.Slow & expensive
2.Fragmented across isolated datasets
3.Lacking digital support for discovery

VenomVerse accelerates lifesaving innovation by turning venom data into research‑ready insights.


🐦‍🔥What is VenomVerse?
VenomVerse is a non‑profit AI research copilot that:
1.Generates biological hypotheses from venom data
2.Suggests research directions aligned with medical need
3.Designs conceptual synthetic peptides
4.Visualizes mock 3D protein structures
5.Provides exportable research reports

All in seconds — through a clean, accessible UI.
